# Snake Game

This is my creation of the famous snake game, popularised by the Nokia mobile phone version. This version runs in the terminal which has been deploed on Heroku.

## User experiences

### User Stories

* As a user I want the instructions to be intuitive.
* As a user I want to be given cues on how I am doing.
* As a user I want to be able to restart the game if I am having a bad run.
* As a user I want text that is easy to see

### Fulfilment of user stories

Examples placed here with screenshots

----------------------
### Flowchat / Wireframes

This is a terminal operated game so there are not as many UX/UI options as previous projects. The terminal style favours this snake game design best I feel as it give the user a 'retro' feel to how the game is.

## How to play

The user has the option of using the arrow keys to move the snake around the terminals  placeholder text etc.etc.etc.

## Technologies Used

### Primary Language
Python

Frameworks and Libraries Used
* Python Standard Library.
* I used Heroku to deploy the live version.
* I used GitHub which allowed me to store my repository.
* My primary IDE was Gitpod which I used for creating and programming as I had unlimited hours through the Code Institute.

## Deployment

The project has been deployed to Heroku and can be found [here](https://snakegamead.herokuapp.com/) 

The Project repository (repo) is at https://github.com/davewatters/pwnytrap-ci-pp3

Note: The project repo was initially generated from the Code Institute Python Essentials template

Deployment of the site to Heroku was done as follows:

* Login to your Heroku account
* Create a New App
* Select the 'Settings' tab first
* Click on 'Reveal Config Vars'
* Add config vars in the KEY/VALUE pair data section
* Select 'Add Buildpack' - add Python and NodeJS
* Select the 'Deploy' tab
* For the Deplyoment Method select GitHub
* Connect to GitHub repo by entering YOUR-REPO-NAME, then Connect
* A message will confirm that your app was successfuly deployed
* Test that the site has successfully gone live by clicking on the 'View' button
* Your app can now be accessed via any browser at: https://YOUR-APP-NAME.heroku.com

## Validator Testing

### PEP8

Speak about using PEP8 for checking all my Python code

### Lighthouse

I will attached a screenshot here and show the final performance score of the website.

## Credits

Attaching any links to videos or books with code which helped me develop this project. I will be adding video to link below to demonstate this.
