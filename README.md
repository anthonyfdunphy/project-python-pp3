Welcome anthonyfdunphy,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

# Snake Game

This is my creation of the famous snake game, popularised by the Nokia mobile phone version. This version runs in the terminal which has been deploed on Heroku.

## User experiences

### User Stories

* As a user I want the instructions to be intuitive.
* As a user I want to be given cues on how I am doing.
* As a user I want to be able to restart the game if I am having a bad run.
* As a user I want text that is easy to see

### Fulfilment of user stories

Examples placed here with screenshots

----------------------
### Flowchat / Wireframes

This is a terminal operated game so there are not as many UX/UI options as previous projects. The terminal style favours this snake game design best I feel as it give the user a 'retro' feel to how the game is.

## How to play

The user has the option of using the arrow keys to move the snake around the terminals  placeholder text etc.etc.etc.

## Technologies Used

### Primary Language
Python

Frameworks and Libraries Used
* Python Standard Library.
* I used Heroku to deploy the live version.
* I used GitHub which allowed me to store my repository.
* My primary IDE was Gitpod which I used for creating and programming as I had unlimited hours through the Code Institute.

## Validator Testing

### PEP8

Speak about using PEP8 for checking all my Python code

### Lighthouse

I will attached a screenshot here and show the final performance score of the website.

## Credits

Attaching any links to videos or books with code which helped me develop this project. I will be adding video to link below to demonstate this.
